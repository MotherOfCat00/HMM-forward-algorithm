## A program that calculates the probability of generating a given sequence by the hidden Markov Model

1. Consider the sequence S (f. ex GGCATGAC)
2. Calculate the probability P(S) that this sequence S was generated by the HMM model (probability  is given by the sum of the probabilities pi(S) of eachpossible path that produces this sequence).

The program is based on the following HMM:
