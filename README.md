# GABi

## A program that calculates the probability of generating a given sequence by the hidden Markov Model

1. Consider the sequence S (f. ex GGCATGAC)
2. Calculate the probability P(S) that this sequence S was generated by the HMM model: this probability  is given by the sum of the probabilities pi(S) of eachpossible path that produces this sequence.
